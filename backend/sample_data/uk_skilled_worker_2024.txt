Consideration of salary (all tradeable points options)

SW 14.1. Salary only includes guaranteed basic gross pay (before income tax and including employee pension and national insurance contributions) and other guaranteed payments which are treated exactly the same as basic gross pay for tax, pension and national insurance purposes .

 
 SW 14.2. Salary does not include other pay and benefits, such as any of the following:
 
 (a)	pay which cannot be guaranteed because the nature of the job means that hours fluctuate; or

 (b)	additional pay such as shift, overtime or bonus pay, (whether or not it is guaranteed); or

 (c)	employer pension and employer national insurance contributions; or

 (d)	any allowances, such as accommodation or cost of living allowances; or

 (e)	in-kind benefits, such as equity shares, health insurance, school or university fees, company cars or food; or

 (f)	one-off payments, such as ‘golden hellos’; or

 (g)	any payments relating to immigration costs, such as the fee or Immigration Health Charge; or

 (h)	payments to cover business expenses, including (but not limited to) travel to and from the applicant’s country of residence, equipment, clothing, travel or subsistence.

 
 

 

 
 SW 14.2A. Any money paid by the applicant to the sponsor (or a related organisation) will be considered as follows:
 
 (a) The following payments will be subtracted from salary, unless (c) applies:
 
 (i) deductions from salary; or

 (ii) repayments of loans; or

 (iii)	investments.

 
 

 (b) Any such subtractions will be averaged over the length of time the applicant is being sponsored for, for the purpose of salary considerations.

 (c) Money will not be deducted where the payment is not related to business costs, immigration costs or investment, but rather an additional benefit offer which the applicant has a genuine choice whether to take up, for example salary sacrifice arrangements.

 
 

 

SW 14.3. If the applicant is being sponsored to work more than 48 hours a week, subject to SW 14.3A, only the salary for the first 48 hours a week will be considered towards the salary thresholds referred to in the table following SW 4.4.

For example, an applicant who works 60 hours a week for £15 per hour will be considered to have a salary of £37,440 (£15 x 48 x 52) per year and not £46,800 (£15 x 60 x 52).

 
 SW 14.3A. If the applicant is being sponsored to work a pattern where the regular hours are not the same each week, resulting in uneven pay:
 
 (a) work in excess of 48 hours in some weeks can be considered towards the salary thresholds, providing the average over a regular cycle (which can be less than, but not more than, 17 weeks) is not more than 48 hours a week; and

 (b) any unpaid rest weeks will count towards the average when considering whether the salary thresholds are met; and

 (c) any unpaid rest weeks will not count as absences from employment for the purpose of paragraph SUI 36.1. of Part Suitability of these rules.

 
 

 For example, an applicant who works a pattern of 60 hours a week for £12 per hour for two weeks, followed by an unpaid rest week, will be considered to work 40 hours a week on average and have a salary of £24,960 (£12 x 40 x 52) per year.

 

 
 SW 14.4. Going rates will be pro-rated to the applicant’s working pattern, as follows:
 
 (a) going rates for SOC 2020 occupation codes listed in Tables 1 to 2a of Appendix Skilled Occupations are based on a 37.5-hour week and will be pro-rated as follows:

 
 

 (the going rate for the SOC 2020 occupation code stated in Tables 1 to 2a of Appendix Skilled Occupations) x (the number of weekly working hours stated by the sponsor ÷ 37.5)
 
 (b)	where an applicant’s salary is required to be 70%, 80% or 90% of the going rate, the resulting figure from the calculation in (a) will be multiplied by 0.7, 0.8 or 0.9 as appropriate, to calculate the required salary; and.

 (c)	going rates for the health and education SOC 2020 occupation codes listed in Tables 3 to 5 of Appendix Skilled Occupations will be pro-rated as stated in Appendix Skilled Occupations; and

 (d)	the applicant’s full weekly hours will be included when checking their salary against the going rate, even if they work more than 48 hours a week.

 
 

 

Transitional arrangements for salary on the Skilled Worker route

 
 SW 14.5. If the applicant is applying for permission to stay or settlement, the applicant was granted permission as a Tier 2 (General) Migrant and has had continuous permission as a Skilled Worker ever since, the following transitional arrangements apply:
 
 (a) if the date of application is before 1 December 2026 salary may also include allowances (the other restrictions in SW 14.20 also apply), providing the following conditions are met:
 
 (i) the applicant is applying to work for the same sponsor as in their previous permission; and

 (ii) the allowances are guaranteed, will be paid for the duration of the applicant’s permission, and would be paid to a local settled worker in similar circumstances, such as London weighting; and

 (iii) the date of application is before 1 December 2026;

 
 

 
 

 the going rates in the table below apply, instead of the going rates listed in Table 2 of Appendix Skilled Occupations. These going rates are based on a 37.5-hour working week and must be pro-rated for other working patterns, based on the weekly working hours stated by the applicant’s sponsor:

 

 
 
 SOC 2010 occupation code
 Equivalent SOC 2020 occupation code(s)

 Immigration Rules Appendix Global Talent

 

 
 
 The Global Talent route is for people aged 18 or over in the field of science, engineering, humanities, social science, medicine, digital technology or arts and culture who can show they have exceptional talent or exceptional promise.

 

 
 
 
 For most individuals there is a two-part application process. The first part is an application for endorsement (guidance on the relevant evidence and its format is set out from time to time by the Secretary of State on gov.uk/global talent); the second part is an application for entry clearance or permission to stay.

A person can make the application for endorsement before making the application for permission, or they can make both applications at the same time.

Alternatively, a person who has been awarded a prestigious prize listed in Appendix Global Talent: Prestigious Prizes is considered as showing exceptional talent and is therefore not required to apply for an endorsement.

A dependent partner and dependent children can apply under this route.

Global Talent is a route to settlement.
